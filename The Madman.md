# The Madman
A young man, who to others is seemingly invisible, sits down at a small table far away from a crowd that has swarmed this rented room. Decorations are strung about the windowless room. Filled with words and phrases that mean nothing to him. What matters most is the reason he has come tonight.

Growing up in a small town, one would think it may be difficult to blend in with the wallpaper, yet he does so with grace. He looks up from the table slowly enough to realize that half the town must be here. He smiles at what he imagines city folk must think of this small town.

Confident that he has remained unknown, he removes a black journal bound with silver strands that come together at the front, forming a sort of hex-shaped lock. For a second, the air becomes alive with electricity.

The journal opens, and he clicks the pen.

Suddenly, he feels the energy flowing from the depths of my mind, cascading through the chambers of his heart, and finally surging into his hand, where it breathes life into the pen.

The world around him fades into a hushed stillness, as if time itself has stopped. This tranquil sanctuary, a haven of solace, wraps him in a cocoon of quietude. As quickly as it happens, it is over, and the chaotic world comes back into focus.

With a heavy sigh, the man sets his pen down, its magic now spent. Just one second earlier there, in his journal, had been a pristine sheet of paper, now the canvas for the frenzied dance of ink, an abstract tapestry of thoughts and emotions. The scrawls, to the untrained eye, look to be scribblings of a Madman. The Madman knows the truth; the paper now holds the essence of his soul, forever etched in the indelible ink.
