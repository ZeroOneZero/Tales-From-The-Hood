# Device & Internet Fix Guide
---
*The following is a generalized guide designed to help diagnose and fix internet issues on your personal device and internet devices. Each step in this guide could potentially resolve the issue independently or in combination with others.*

## Troubleshoot a Personal Device
---

### Verify Power

* Ensure the power supply is the correct one for your device. Most power supplies in the US use 110 volts AC as the input voltage. Check the output voltage, which will provide the exact amount of power required by your device. You can often find this information on a sticker somewhere on the device, indicating the required voltage and Amps.

### Check Cables

* Inspect the entire length of all the cables for any visible damage. If possible, test them with another device to confirm their functionality.

### Reset and Sync

* If all else fails, reset your device to factory settings. Refer to your device's manual or reach out to me for assistance with the exact steps to do this. Afterward, you may have to synchronize it with a new account if the old one had issues.

### Software Update

* Ensure your deviceâ€™s software and firmware are up-to-date. Manufacturers often issue firmware updates to enhance performance or protect against security vulnerabilities found in the existing firmware. Some devices perform this update automatically, but most do not. Check with your device's manufacturer if you are unsure.

### Check for Overheating

* Excessive heat can cause performance issues. Ensure your device is not overheating and that its cooling system is functioning properly.

## Internet Device Troubleshooting
---

### Verify Power

* Similar to the first step above, check the modem and Wi-Fi router power supplies to ensure that they are delivering the correct voltage and amperage.

### Check Cables

* Cables to consider here include power wires and internet-specific cables, such as DSL (Phone line wire), Cable (Coaxial), and Ethernet (CAT5e or CAT6+), which can be verified by noting the length of the wire. If you have two devices, one could be your modem (direct connection to your ISP) and the other your Wi-Fi router (which creates a separate network to protect your devices from outside influence through firewalls).

### Reset and Sync

* If all else fails, reset both your modem and Wi-Fi router to factory defaults. Contact your ISP and refer to your device's manual for the exact steps to do this. Afterwards, you may need to reset the router's admin password, and the Wi-Fi access password may have changed. Refer to the sticker on the underside of the router for additional information.

### Update Router Firmware

* Most connectivity issues can be resolved by updating your router's firmware. Check your router manufacturer's website for details on how to do this.

### Firmware and Configuration

* Once the devices are up and operational, it's time to configure your Wi-Fi router. Set a unique Wi-Fi name and password, but leave the other settings default until after internet connectivity has been verified. During the testing phase, connect only the essential devices.

### Signal Strength

* Ensure your device is within good range of your Wi-Fi router. Walls and distance can decrease signal strength.

### Check with the ISP

* If you're still experiencing internet issues, it might be worth checking with your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to ensure there are no issues or outages in your area.
