Installing Windows 10 from a USB drive is a straightforward process. Before you begin, make sure you have a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage and a Windows 10 installation media file. Follow these steps to install Windows 10:

Create a bootable USB drive:

a. Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10

b. Run the Media Creation Tool and accept the license terms.

c. Select "Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC" and click "Next."

d. Choose the language, edition, and architecture (32-bit, 64-bit, or both) for Windows 10, then click "Next."

e. Select "USB flash drive" and click "Next."

f. Choose your USB drive from the list and click "Next." The tool will download and create a bootable Windows 10 USB drive.

Prepare your computer:

a. Turn off your computer.

b. Plug the bootable USB drive into an available USB port on your computer.

c. Turn on your computer and press the appropriate key to access the boot menu (usually F12, F10, F8, or Del). Refer to your computer's manual for the specific key if needed.

d. In the boot menu, select your USB drive as the first boot device and press "Enter."

Install Windows 10:

a. Wait for the Windows 10 setup screen to appear.

b. Select your language, time and currency format, and keyboard or input method, then click "Next."

c. Click "Install now."

d. If you have a Windows 10 product key, enter it now. If you don't have one, click "I don't have a product key" to continue with the installation. You can enter the key later after installation.

e. Choose the Windows 10 edition you want to install and click "Next."

f. Accept the license terms and click "Next."

g. Choose the "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" installation type.

h. Select the drive where you want to install Windows 10. If you're unsure, it's typically the largest drive with the most unallocated space. Click "Next."

i. The installation process will begin, and your computer may restart several times during the process. Be patient, as this can take some time.

Complete the setup:

a. After the installation, Windows 10 will guide you through the setup process.

b. Customize your settings, connect to a Wi-Fi network, and create or sign in with a Microsoft account.

c. Once you've completed the setup, you'll arrive at the Windows 10 desktop.

Install drivers and updates:

a. Connect to the internet, if you haven't already.

b. Install any necessary drivers for your computer's hardware.

c. Check for Windows updates by going to "Settings" > "Update & Security" > "Windows Update," and click "Check for updates." Install any available updates.

Your Windows 10 installation is now complete. You can remove the USB drive and start using your computer.
