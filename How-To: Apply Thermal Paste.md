# How-To: Apply Thermal Paste

## Prerequisites
---
*  High-quality thermal paste

> **Note:** Prolimatech PK-2 Nano Aluminum, Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Thermal Grease, Arctic MX-6, Cooler Master MasterGel Pro V2, and Noctua NT-H1 are highly recommended for different budgets and use cases. Ensure the thermal paste you choose is compatible with your CPU cooler's materials. For instance, non-conductive paste is suitable for use with aluminum or aluminum alloy coolers.

*   CPU and Cooler
*   Isopropyl alcohol (preferably 99%)
*   Lint-free, microfiber cloth or coffee filter
*   Plastic card (optional)

> **Note:** It is crucial to work on a static-free surface to prevent potential damage to the CPU or other components.

## Removing the CPU Cooler
---
*   Before you begin the application of thermal paste, ensure that your working environment is clean and dust-free to prevent contamination. If you're removing an old cooler, the methods differ slightly between Intel and AMD coolers. Unlatch or unscrew the securing mechanism.

> **Note:** Always handle it with care to prevent damaging the CPU or the pins on the motherboard.

*   After loosening and removing the retention system (screws, clips, or levers), gently twist the cooler left and right to break any adhesion between it and the CPU, then lift it straight off.

## Clean the CPU
---
*   While the CPU can be removed for cleaning, it is generally advisable to clean it in its socket to avoid potential damage, such as bending the pins or introducing contaminants. If the CPU has been previously used, traces of old thermal paste might be present. Use a microfiber or a lint-free cloth with 99% isopropyl to gently clean off the old paste from the CPU and cooler base.

## Apply the Thermal Paste
---
*   A drop about the size of a pea or a grain of rice is usually sufficient. Apply this at the center of the CPU.

> **Note:** Certain thermal pastes contain metal, which can be harmful as it can cause short circuits if it spills onto the motherboard or other components. Therefore, when applying thermal paste, use only the minimum amount needed to fill the air gaps to avoid such issues. Too much thermal paste can act as an insulator, degrading its effectiveness.

## (Optional) Spread the Paste
---
*   Although the pressure from the cooler during installation will spread the paste, some prefer to manually spread a thin layer over the surface of the CPU using a plastic card.

> **Note:** While this technique can be effective, it's also challenging given the limited space due to the CPU's position on the motherboard and within the PC case.

*   Some high-quality pastes include tools for easier application. For instance, Thermal Grizzly comes with cleaning pads and a spatula that can help you apply it more accurately. Once done correctly, it should create an even layer without any air bubbles, which can reduce thermal efficiency.

## Install the Cooler
---
*   Now, it's time to place your cooler on the CPU. Aim to place it straight down to prevent creating air bubbles and to maximize thermal contact. Secure the cooler as per the instructions provided with it.

## Final Checks
---
*   Once the cooler is secure, your CPU is ready! Conduct a quick check to ensure everything looks correct and that there's been no spillage before you start reassembling your PC.
